IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR SPIKE2

ERROR MESSAGES

 - The spike2 spec does not determine what error messages should look
   like, other than requiring that they be sent to stderr rather than
   stdout.

 - However, since our spike1 includes such lovely abilities to
   identify exact positions in input files, implementors are
   encourages to make use of that in their error messages.

 - For example, here are some possible error messages that could be
   generated while spike2 parsing the e10.expi file:

    e10.expi:1:2: Expected ';' but found '#'
    e10.expi:3:16: Expected ';' but found '!'
    e10.expi:5:1: Expected primary expression but found '''
    e10.expi:5:9: Expected ':' but found '_'
    e10.expi:9:5: Expected ';' but found 'eeekekekekekekekekekeke'
